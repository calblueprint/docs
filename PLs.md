## Introduction

Simply put, project leading is the most mission-critical position in Blueprint.
As a project leader (PL), you are directly responsible for putting Blueprint's
vision into practice.

We place very high expectations on our PLs and subsequently very high value as
well. That doesn't mean you aren't allowed to fail; it simply means that you
must take your role seriously. In fact, project leading is difficult enough
that it would be abnormal if you did not run into failure at some point in the
process. The point is to learn from mistakes and recover.

#### What this doc is and isn't

This document is a set of guidelines and principles learned from experience,
written by project leaders just like you. Although we provide practical
examples, it isn't a step-by-step guide detailing what to do every step of the
way.

This is a living document. Is something missing? Add it. Is something not
relevant or useful? Remove it. The handbook isn't the One True Answer to project
leading. Rather, it's a foundation that you can use to make your project and
your team more successful and happy.

This handbook is focused. We avoid minute details in favor of more general
principles.

This is an interactive document. We'll ask you at some points to stop reading
and think or write things down. This means you should actually stop and think!
Actively engage with the guidelines here instead of passively absorbing.

We hope you'll learn a thing or two from this handbook. We also hope that you'll
leave behind something you've learned as well.

Let's get started!

## The guidelines of project leading

These are the most important characteristics of successful projects and teams.
If you remember nothing else, remember these.

**Get users.** It's easy to spot a project on a trajectory for success: it has
users. It's that simple. Pilot unfinished work if people can use it. The
earlier you get users, the less time you'll spend building things that don't
matter.

**Be focused.** Pin down precisely the one or two pain points for the nonprofit
that your project will do vastly better than what they currently use. Refuse to
do anything else until these are finished. See
[The Product Death Cycle][product-death-cycle].

**Fail fast.** The worst thing you can do for yourself and your team is to try
to hide problems away. Identify problems when they're small. Face them head-on
them with your mentor and/or your team. Are your team members not meeting your
expectations of work? Is your nonprofit not engaged with the project? As the
project leader, you must be able to spot and admit to failure. Only then can you
start working towards improvement.

**Over-communicate.** You aren't communicating enough if you aren't over-
communicating. This means knowing the state of your team and your nonprofit all
the time; this means you should allocate time specifically for this. See
[Seven Plus or Minus Three][seven-plus-minus-three] and [Bored People
Quit][bored-people-quit].

You'll notice that the rest of this handbook revolves around putting these
principles into practice. Keep these guidelines in mind as you read on.

## Preparation

#### Understanding the nonprofit

It goes without saying that understanding the nonprofit is a prerequisite for
project success. Here are specific questions you should have a clear answer to
as the project begins.

- What is the nonprofit's mission?
- What is keeping them from fulfilling it? What are the top one/two biggest
  roadblocks?
- How will your project solve these problems?

For example, here are the answers to these questions for the [Berkeley Public
Schools Fund][bpsf] project:

- The Berkeley Public Schools Fund raises and distributes funding to schools and
  teachers in the Berkeley Unified Schools District.
- BPSF does not have enough money for all the projects teachers want to do.
  Community members are willing to donate but find the existing system difficult
  to navigate.
- By making it easy for people to donate to specific teachers' projects, we can
  increase the overall amount of funding in the district.

Your answers should be similarly pointed and succinct. Stop now and think about
/ write down your responses to these questions.

Expect your answers to change over time, but you should be able to easily answer
these questions at any point in time during the project. Trust your gut; get in
contact with your nonprofit earlier rather than later, even if you just had a
meeting. This is important to get right.

#### Preparing to lead a team

TODO(sam): Make this section better...

The first thing you should know is that it's okay to worry.

The goal is to remain focused on your overall vision rather than fighting fires.
The most common scenario is Blueprint is that the project leader fights fires
all the time while everyone else is unaware. This unfortunate result comes from
seeing everyone else supposedly doing well and wanting to appear like you have
no problems either, leading to further isolation.

We can approach this issue in two ways.

First, we emphasize honest communication. This is everyone's responsibility.
E-Team and project mentors should create space for PLs to share openly. As a
little example, during the project leaders meeting E-Team can ask, "What has
been the biggest struggle in leading your team this week?". PLs should be
actively identifying and prioritizing problems before they have time to grow.

Second, we can anticipate problems and design around them. For example, teams
tend to slow down around midterm season and we can take that into account when
creating a timeline for the project.
