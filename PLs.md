## Introduction

It can be said that project leading is the most mission-critical position in
Blueprint. As a project leader (PL), you are directly responsible for putting
Blueprint's vision into practice.

We place very high expectations on our PLs and subsequently very high value as
well. That doesn't mean you aren't allowed to fail; it simply means that you
must take your role seriously. In fact, project leading is difficult enough
that it would be abnormal if you did not run into failure at some point in the
process. The point is to learn from mistakes and recover.

#### What this doc is and isn't

This document is a set of guidelines and principles learned from experience,
written by project leaders just like you. It isn't a step-by-step guide
detailing what to do every step of the way.

This is a living document. Is something missing? Add it. Is something not
relevant or useful? Remove it. The handbook isn't the One True Answer to project
leading. Rather, it's a foundation that you'll use to make your team more
successful and happy.
