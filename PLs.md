## Introduction

Simply put, project leading is the most mission-critical position in Blueprint.
As a project leader (PL), you are directly responsible for putting Blueprint's
vision into practice.

We place very high expectations on our PLs and subsequently very high value as
well. That doesn't mean you aren't allowed to fail; it simply means that you
must take your role seriously. In fact, project leading is difficult enough
that it would be abnormal if you did not run into failure at some point in the
process. The point is to learn from mistakes and recover.

#### What this doc is and isn't

This document is a set of guidelines and principles learned from experience,
written by project leaders just like you. Although we provide practical
examples, it isn't a step-by-step guide detailing what to do every step of the
way.

This is a living document. Is something missing? Add it. Is something not
relevant or useful? Remove it. The handbook isn't the One True Answer to project
leading. Rather, it's a foundation that you can use to make your project and
your team more successful and happy.

This handbook is focused. If you'd like to add an idea, first ask: Can PLs
succeed without this idea? If the answer is yes, think twice about adding it.

This is an interactive document. We'll ask you at some points to stop reading
and think or write things down. This means you should actually stop and think!
Actively engage with the guidelines here instead of passively absorbing.

We hope you'll learn a thing or two from this handbook. We also hope that you'll
leave behind something you've learned as well.

Let's get started!

## The guidelines of project leading

These are the most important characteristics of successful projects and teams.
If you remember nothing else, remember these.

**Get users.** It's easy to spot a project on a trajectory for success: it has
users. It's that simple. Give people unfinished work if they can use it. The
earlier you get users, the less time you'll spend building things that don't
matter.

**Be focused.** Pin down precisely the one or two pain points for the nonprofit
that your project will do better than what they currently use. Refuse to do
anything else until these are finished. See
[The Product Death Cycle][product-death-cycle].

**Fail fast.** The worst thing you can do for yourself and your team is to try
to hide problems away. Identify problems when they're small. Face them head-on
them with your mentor and/or your team. Are your team members not meeting your
expectations of work? Is your nonprofit not engaged with the project? As the
project leader, you must be able to spot and admit to failure. Only then can you
start working towards improvement.

**Over-communicate.** You aren't communicating enough if you aren't
over-communicating. This means knowing what's up with your team and your
nonprofit all the time, which means you should allocate time accordingly. See
[Seven Plus or Minus Three][seven-plus-minus-three] and
[Bored People Quit][bored-people-quit].

You'll notice that the rest of this handbook revolves around putting these
principles into practice. Keep these guidelines in mind as you read on.
