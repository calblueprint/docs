## Introduction

Simply put, project leading is the most mission-critical position in Blueprint.
As a project leader (PL), you are directly responsible for putting Blueprint's
vision into practice.

We place very high expectations on our PLs and subsequently very high value as
well. That doesn't mean you aren't allowed to fail; it simply means that you
must take your role seriously. In fact, project leading is difficult enough
that it would be abnormal if you did not run into failure at some point in the
process. The point is to learn from mistakes and recover.

#### What this doc is and isn't

This document is a set of guidelines and principles learned from experience,
written by project leaders just like you. Although we provide practical
examples, it isn't a step-by-step guide detailing what to do every step of the
way.

This is a living document. Is something missing? Add it. Is something not
relevant or useful? Remove it. The handbook isn't the One True Answer to project
leading. Rather, it's a foundation that you can use to make your project and
your team more successful and happy.

This handbook is focused. We avoid minute details in favor of more general
principles.

This is an interactive document. We'll ask you at some points to stop reading
and think or write things down. This means you should actually stop and think!
Actively engage with the guidelines here instead of passively absorbing.

We hope you'll learn a thing or two from this handbook. We also hope that you'll
leave behind something you've learned as well.

Let's get started!

## The guidelines of project leading

These are the most important characteristics of successful projects and teams.
If you remember nothing else, remember these.

**Get users.** It's easy to spot a project on a trajectory for success: it has
users. It's that simple. Pilot unfinished work if people can use it. The
earlier you get users, the less time you'll spend building things that don't
matter.

**Be focused.** Pin down precisely the one or two pain points for the nonprofit
that your project will do vastly better than what they currently use. Refuse to
do anything else until these are finished. See
[The Product Death Cycle][product-death-cycle].

**Fail fast.** The worst thing you can do for yourself and your team is to try
to hide problems away. Identify problems when they're small. Face them head-on
them with your mentor and/or your team. Are your team members not meeting your
expectations of work? Is your nonprofit not engaged with the project? As the
project leader, you must be able to spot and admit to failure. Only then can you
start working towards improvement.

**Over-communicate.** You aren't communicating enough if you aren't over-
communicating. This means knowing the state of your team and your nonprofit all
the time; this means you should allocate time specifically for this. See
[Seven Plus or Minus Three][seven-plus-minus-three] and [Bored People
Quit][bored-people-quit].

You'll notice that the rest of this handbook revolves around putting these
principles into practice. Keep these guidelines in mind as you read on.

## Preparation

#### Understanding the nonprofit

It goes without saying that understanding the nonprofit is a prerequisite for
project success. Here are specific questions you should have a clear answer to
as the project begins.

- What is the nonprofit's mission?
- What is keeping them from fulfilling it? What are the top one/two biggest
  roadblocks?
- How will your project solve these problems?

For example, here are the answers to these questions for the [Berkeley Public
Schools Fund][bpsf] project:

- The Berkeley Public Schools Fund raises and distributes funding to schools and
  teachers in the Berkeley Unified Schools District.
- BPSF does not have enough money for all the projects teachers want to do.
  Community members are willing to donate but find the existing system difficult
  to navigate.
- By making it easy for people to donate to specific teachers' projects, we can
  increase the overall amount of funding in the district.

Your answers should be similarly pointed and succinct. Stop now and think about
/ write down your responses to these questions.

Expect your answers to change over time, but you should be able to easily answer
these questions at any point in time during the project. Trust your gut; get in
contact with your nonprofit earlier rather than later, even if you just had a
meeting. This is important to get right.

#### Leading a team

TODO(sam): Write this.

## The first team meeting

The first team meeting is where you set the tone for the rest of the semester.
First impressions last, so come into the meeting prepared.

You should look to go over these things (listed in no particular order):

**The team**

- Something to help the team get to know each other. Ideally this would be
  something that would let each of you talk about something you like. For
  example, "What is your current favorite hobby?". (This also serves as a good
  way to get ideas for banquet gifts.)

**The nonprofit**

- The nonprofit and why you think their mission is important. Your goal here is
  to get your team motivated on more than just an abstract level.
- The core problem that you are solving for the nonprofit. How is Blueprint the
  best solution for their problem? What impact will solving this problem have on
  the nonprofit?

**Expectations**

- It's very important to discuss your style of leadership and what you expect
  from your members. Doing this seems redundant but is necessary. Many team
  management issues stem from a misunderstanding of expectations.

    We suggest that you take some time during the meeting to explicitly say what
    your expectations and why you have them. Even better, sit down with your
    team and come up with team expectations / values together.

    Here are some examples that have worked for project teams before:

    - > Because we only have X weeks to produce a working prototype for the
      nonprofit, I expect that you commit to finishing the work you take on
      before our team meeting each week. It's okay if you can't finish the work,
      but you have to **communicate** this to me so that someone else on the
      team can take it up.

    - > I expect you to make it to the meetings each week with few exceptions.
      It's super important that we meet in order to be on the same page and to
      stay motivated to work on this project. If at point in time you feel like
      the meetings aren't worth going to, I hope that you will notify me so we
      can work together to make them better.

    - > You can expect to learn and grow through this project. I will do my best
      to help you in whatever way I can, whether it's through reassigning work,
      mentoring, or letting you take charge of a team / nonprofit meeting.

## Getting the most out of meetings

You will be meeting with a number of different parties quite frequently as a
project lead. Meeting are notorious for being tiresome and unhelpful, but they
don't have to be.

The easiest way to improve the quality of your meetings is preparation.

#### Team meetings

Come into team meetings with specific things to discuss. What you want to avoid
is something like:

> Hello all, good work last week. The nonprofit is happy. You know what to work
on, so let's start coding.

This is fine for a work session but probably not for every meeting. Here are
some things you can try instead.

- Praising a team member.

    > I'd like to thank Wonjun for stepping up and taking on some of Sam's work
    this week when he was struggling to study for a midterm. Because of Wonjun's
    effort, we're going to be able to demo this feature at the NPO meeting
    tomorrow.

- Or the whole team.

    > You guys really pushed hard this week to get this done! Thanks to everyone
    for being willing to work so much. We definitely shouldn't be working that
    late regularly but it made the difference at the demo last week.

- Reiterating a short-term or a long-term goal.

    > We want to show PHC this specific feature next week. Since that's soon, it
    doesn't have to be perfect. We'll focus on getting things working.

- Discussing the state of the project.

    > A couple weeks ago, we decided that we wanted these features to be
    complete by today. We're only about halfway there on each of these
    features. Do you think the deadline we set at that time was reasonable?

    > Moving forward, I'd like to take one person from feature B and move
    him/her to feature A since that's more mission-critical. Are there any
    objections?

- Debriefing a nonprofit meeting.

    > At the Bizworld meeting last week, we discussed feature X and they loved
    the functionality. However, we agreed that it would be difficult for someone
    to use it, so this meeting we'll think of the best bang-for-the-buck UI
    improvements and work on those through next week.

You get the idea. Your goal at each team meeting is to get everyone on the same
page and refocus the team.
